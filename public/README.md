# PWA Icons

This folder contains icons for the Progressive Web App.

## Required Icons

For full PWA functionality, you need to add these icon files:

- `pwa-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels (required)
- `pwa-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels (required)
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 pixels (for iOS)
- `favicon.ico` - Standard favicon (optional)

## Quick Icon Generation

You can generate these icons using:
1. Online tools: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Convert the provided `icon.svg` to PNG using an image editor
3. Use any image editor to create icons with your branding

The PWA will work without these icons, but they're recommended for the best user experience.
